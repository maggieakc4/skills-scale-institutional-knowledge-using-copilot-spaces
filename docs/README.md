# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This README provides an overview of how OctoAcme runs projects, with links to detailed process documents for each phase and key practice.

## Summary of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme follows a structured, iterative approach to project management that emphasizes:

- **Clear roles and core artifacts for every project** — Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Manager (PdM) who coordinate delivery and define outcomes
- **Defined phases** — Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective ensure a consistent project lifecycle
- **Strong risk, communication, and stakeholder management** — Proactive identification of risks and transparent communication keep all parties aligned
- **Focus on continuous improvement and measurement of outcomes** — Teams capture learnings and iterate based on data and feedback

Processes are designed to improve transparency, enable repeatable success, and accelerate new team member onboarding.
